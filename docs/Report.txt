1.
vars: weekly classes from every course
domains: every possible combination of room and time slot
constraints: room, one class at a time, teoricas no mesmo dia

2. 
MRV: reduces branching, less backtracks. (time complexity of DFS)
LCV: flexibility, tries to keep the domain as broad as possible, in order to find the first solution earlier
FC vs MAC: all variables are neighbors to each other, therefore FC does a substantial propagation of constraints. MAC is more complex and does a similar job. In case of sparser graphs the difference would be noticeable.
